  <p>Scoops of homemade vegan chocolate ice cream piled onto gluten-free vegan sugar cones</p>

<p>I’ve been on a mission to create creamy, rich vegan chocolate ice cream, and it almost stumped me.</p>

<p>My first attempt lacked depth of dark chocolate flavor.
My second attempt came closer, but lacked creaminess.
  And my third attempt? Total winner.</p>

<p>Creamy, insanely rich chocolate flavor that’s somewhere between ice cream and gelato. Get your ice cream maker, kids. We’re doin’ this.</p>

  <p>Whisking together chocolate for making vegan chocolate ice cream</p>

<p>This recipe requires just 6 ingredients and simple methods. If you can whisk, blend, and pour into an ice cream maker, you can master this easy recipe.</p>


<p>The base is comprised of water, cocoa powder, rich coconut cream, and organic cane sugar, which is whisked together. Then comes the deep chocolate flavor: from plenty of vegan dark chocolate.</p>

<p>The last ingredient is vanilla extract, which enhances the flavor and helps prevent ice crystals (because of the alcohol content). Then simply blend, chill, and wait patiently until it’s time to churn.</p>
    <p>This ice cream is insanely creamy and so, so rich in chocolate flavor. It satisfied that craving I had for the chocolate ice cream I enjoyed back in my dairy-eating days.</p>

<p>This will make the perfect treat to have on hand this summer for snacking or for hosting. I highly recommend serving this with fresh strawberries and coconut whipped cream. And whoops, what if a raw brownie falls in the bowl? Bliss.</p>
